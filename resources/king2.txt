Oh ... you fought well. You were able to defeat my body and free my soul. My body was poisoned by the radiation in these dungeons. I grew insane and tried to rule the entire world!

Fortunately you stopped me. I hope my family and my people can forget the evil I have done to my kingdom.

There is one last thing I can do for you ... The dimension portal is now set to your time and space. Just step in it and you can return home now.

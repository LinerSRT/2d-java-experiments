Are you the strange one from the southern desert? If you are, you may be our kingdom's last hope in this terrible crisis.

As you might know, King Lionel was exploring the northern mountains years ago when he mysteriously vanished. Since then, our kingdom has been tormented by demons and difficulty.

Last month, Princess Sarah was kidnapped during her trip to the Sun Temple. I have dispatched my best knight squads to rescue her, but all have disappeared.

I hope you will save my daughter, the Princess, and restore peace to this kingdom. Do this and I will bestow upon you a fabulous key that opens one of the treasure rooms in this palace.

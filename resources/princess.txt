Thank you for rescuing me! The rumor is true -- my father King Lionel is still alive!

Last month, I learned that King Lionel had been seen in this Sun Temple. That news was so shocking, I decided to search for him myself.

After a dangerous journey to this place, I finally found my father, King Lionel. He looked and acted very different from the loving father I remembered. He was standing right before me, yet I scarcely recognized him. He demanded my Phoenix Ring! I hesitated and suddenly he started to attack! I was overwhelmed by his amazing strength and quickness and I was easily defeated. However, I was able to hide the Ring from him. After he searched and failed, he decided to lock me in the Sun Temple.

Thank you again for saving me, but I can not bring myself to fight the man who was once my loving father. Please take my Phoenix Ring and wear it! It will stop my father from doing more evil, and it will help restore peace to this land.
